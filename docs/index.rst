drf-commons Documentation
=========================

This documentation set is designed for direct use by Python library documentation platforms (Read the Docs, GitHub Pages, PyPI links, or self-hosted Sphinx).

It is split into two layers:

1. Narrative documentation for architecture, usage, DRF pain points, and limitations.
2. Exhaustive API reference generated from every Python module under ``drf_commons``.
